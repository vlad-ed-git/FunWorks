# FunWorks
A collection of projects I do just for the fun of it. Each branch is a different project. 
Branch names with "_godot_game" suffix require the godot game engine to run. 


1. Epic Bolz Game made with Godot game engine. Thanks to Heiny Reimes and (@ Whiplash) for the idea (they own the work too, I'm simply the developer :) ).
